# Neural Network Basics
Basics of Neural Network , gradient descent, hands on mini project   

This repo contains the following notebooks:  

* **Gradient Descent:** Introduction to Gradient descent: we'll implement the basic functions of the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the boundary in a small dataset.
I have implemented the following:  
  - Sigmoid activation function
  - Output (prediction) formula
  - Error function
  - The function that updates the weights  
  
  In the end we have written a training loop  iterate the gradient descent algorithm through all the data, 
  for a number of epochs. 
  It will also plot the data, and some of the boundary lines obtained as we run the algorithm.  
  
* **Analyzing Student Data:**: In this notebook, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
  - GRE Scores (Test)
  - GPA Scores (Grades)
  - Class rank (1-4)  

  The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/
